# Binary-Search-Tree
The goal of this program is to implement a binary search tree using different ADT’s, such as queues and linked lists. The program will take an input file and convert it to binary trees, then calculating the search costs for the nodes in the trees. The Data structure we used for this assignment revolves around Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees. A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that contains nodes with each node having no more than two children. The left sub-tree contains only nodes with less than the parent node and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the parent node. In this program functions inorder, printTree, getTotalSearchTimes are implemented to calculate the search costs. The functions insert, remove, maxD are necessary to build the binary tree from the input file. To compile this program, you can use your desired IDE. Or, you can use your terminal to locate the file by typing “cd name”. When you see the desired file name, type g++ *.cpp then enter. This compiles the program. Test files are provided to build the binary tree and to find the costs.
